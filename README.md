# BikStrap-Win
Work In progress Windows Bootstrapping Utility.  (хдх)
Currently intalls `scoop` launches Chris Titus's [winutil](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil).

#### What it does:
- Installs [scoop](https://scoop.sh/#/) and launches Chris Titus's [winutil](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil).
- Installs GlazeWM for a sane window management
- Installs Msys2, then the MingW toolchain
    - I use this for C/C++ Development

#### TODO:
- [ ] softlink GlazeWM config
- [ ] Autostart GlazeWM
- [ ] Own powershell profile

> This setup makes it so that windows is still bareable to use, I still prefer to use a Linux Environment but if I'm forced to use windows, I will definitely going to use this. I rather don't want to use WSL2 because it still consumes a lot of ram, added to the bloat what windows uses.
